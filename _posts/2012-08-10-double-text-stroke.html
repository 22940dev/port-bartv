title: CSS tip - double text stroke
---

<p>While watching the 2012 Olympics in London on television I saw BMX riders cycling on their tiny bikes with amazing speeds. The shirt of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bmx+colombia">Colombian riders</a> made me come up with the following double text stroke with css.</p>

<h4>HTML</h4>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1 class=&quot;stroked&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>CSS</h4>
<pre><code class="language-css">@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Bangers);

.stroked {
  font: 8em/1 Bangers, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  -webkit-text-stroke: .025em #fff; <span class="code-comment">/* The white stroke, first from inside out */</span>
  -webkit-text-fill-color: #444; <span class="code-comment">/* Make the inner text white */</span>
  text-shadow: <span class="code-comment">/* These four shadows create the most outer stroke */</span>
    -.025em -.025em 0 #444,  
    .025em -.025em 0 #444,
    -.025em  .025em 0 #444,
    .025em  .025em 0 #444;
  color: #fff; <span class="code-comment">/* For non-webkit-browsers */</span>
}</code></pre>

<p>That last css rule acts as a fallback for browsers that don’t support the <code>text-stroke</code> property. It makes the text go white instead of dark gray.</p>

<p>The effect doesn’t look really great at large font-sizes, but for the time being it will do. I am aware that there are several methods to accomplish this kind of effect, but it seemed nice to give this a try.</p>
