title: Five simple steps to improve your typography
---

<p>With the responsive webdesign trend going on lately, more and more focus is put on typography. No matter if you look on a 27 inch desktop screen or a 3 inch handheld device: readability is paramount. I have collected five simple techniques to instantly improve your typography (and mine, of course).</p>

<h2 id="use-ems-for-scalable-font-sizes">1. Use ems for scalable font-sizes</h2>

<p><strong>Move away from the pixels!</strong> That would be a great quote for a designer to start a workshop with, isn’t it!? Use ems and rems instead. As <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units">W3C explains</a>, ems are a relative unit, so if a parent element has a calculated font-size of 16px and it’s child has a font-size of 0.875em, then the calculated font-size of the child will be 14px. The advantage? Scalability. If we increase the parent’s to 2em, the child’s font-size will automatically scale up to 28px.</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;p&gt;Simple content &lt;span class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;smaller&lt;/span&gt; and back to normal&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css">html {
    font-size: 100%; <span class="code-comment">/* Adapt to browser default font-size */</span>
}
p {
    font-size: 1em; <span class="code-comment">/* 16px */</span>
}
.child {
    font-size: 0.875em; <span class="code-comment">/* 0.875 x 16px = 14px */</span>
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="increase-line-height">2. Increase line-height</h2>

<p>Large pieces of text become hard to read real quickly. By increasing the line-height (leading, as it’s called in traditional typography) of the body copy the text becomes less cramped together and gets some breathing space. Line-height is a unit-less property. This means that adding em, % or px is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height">not needed</a> (but you can if you want!) as the line-height is relative to the font-size.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">html {
    line-height: 1.5;
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="consistent-margins">3. Consistent margins</h2>

<p>Create vertical rhythm by using consistent margins. Let each heading and paragraph have the same distance in relation to each other. Harry Roberts wrote an <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2012/06/single-direction-margin-declarations/">article about that</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="code-comment">/**
 * HEADINGS
 * 1: Reset line-height to 1.1 to ease positioning;
 * 2: Create a relatively large margin-top and a smaller 
      margin-bottom to visually detach the headings from
      their preceeding element and attach them to the 
      next element;
 */</span>
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
    line-height: 1.1; <span class="code-comment">/* -1- */</span>
    margin: 3rem auto 0.75rem; <span class="code-comment">/* -2- */</span>
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="maximum-paragraph-length">4. Maximum paragraph-length</h2>

<p>According to <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2012/06/19/fluid-type/">several</a> <a href="http://adamdscott.com/typography/set-your-measure-optimizing-line-length-for-reading/">studies</a> readability increases by setting the number of characters per line between 45 and 75. That is relatively easy to accomplish with CSS, assuming that a single character takes up <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/em/">about 0.5em of space</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">p {
    max-width: 34em; <span class="code-comment">/* That&rsquo;s about 68 characters */</span>
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="provide-contrast">5. Provide contrast</h2>

<p>Reading black text on a black background is, well, pretty much impossible. Reading white text on a black background will hurt your eyes within less than five minutes. I am exaggerating of course, but it is important to realize this. I don’t know of a golden formula to calculate if a text and background have enough contrast to make it readable and not have too much contrast to make it painful, but if you do: please let me know. Here’s two rules I generally use to make stuff readable.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">html {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; <span class="code-comment">/* Not white */</span>
    color: #333; <span class="code-comment">/* Not black */</span>
}</code></pre>

<p>Good luck improving the readability of your website!</p>
