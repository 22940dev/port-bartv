title: Introducing Spanner.js - Lettering.js on steroids
---

<p>In an attempt to make the web faster, more and more developers are trying to discard frameworks and use tools like <a href="http://requirejs.org/">Require.js</a> to only load files when they are really needed. As a result, many of the <em>great</em> plugins written for these frameworks become useless. Even one of my all-time favorites: Dave Rupert’s <a href="http://letteringjs.com/">Lettering.js</a>. So I thought it would be a great time to take matters into my own hands, so last week I created a jQuery-free, plain Javascript version of Lettering.js, called <a href="https://github.com/bartveneman/Spanner.js">Spanner.js</a>. And I can tell you: it’s pretty darn fast!</p>

<h2>What’s different?</h2>
<p>As Lettering.js uses strings or innerHTML to apply the wrapping, Spanner.js takes a DOM based approach. This presents an improvement right away: Spanner.js is capable of dealing with inline tags in your targeted element(s), such as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for example.
Another difference is that Spanner.js is framework independent, whereas Lettering.js is a jQuery plugin. So there’s no overhead when using Spanner.js for your kerning.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Spanner.js works at blazing speeds, as <a href="http://jsperf.com/my-lettering-vs-jquery-lettering/6">tests on JSPerf.com show</a>. According to these tests Spanner.js is up to 26 times faster!</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Using Spanner.js is quite easy. After including Spanner.js at the bottom of your page, there is a globally available function called <em>spanner</em>, which you can use to apply the spanning to your element(s).</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;h1 id="kern-me"&gt;Text&lt;/h1&gt;
<span class="code-comment">&lt;!-- lots of other stuff here --&gt;</span>
&lt;script src="path/to/spanner.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Select context and apply spanning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">spanner( document.getElementById("kern-me") );</code></pre>
<p>And voila, you’re done! The resulting html should be like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;h1 id="kern-me"&gt;
    &lt;span class="char1"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="char2"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="char5"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="char4"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;</code> </pre>

<h2>Drawbacks of Spanner.js</h2>
<p>Yes, there are some drawbacks. Lettering.js is capable of splitting your content into words or lines and <a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js/wiki">add classes accordingly</a>. I haven’t added these functionalitites to Spanner.js yet, but might do that in the future. But is you’re in a forking mood, please have a go yourself!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all this is just another Javascript tool, but I still hope you’ll find it a useful addition to your toolbox.
